Notes & Recommendations
-----------------------
- These credentials are sensitive. Store them in a secure password manager rather than in plain text.
- Change default or shared passwords on first login, and ensure each user has a unique, strong password.
- Enforce MFA/2FA for admin and vet accounts if possible.
- Do not commit this file to version control or shared drives.
- If these credentials are for testing only, clearly mark them as test accounts and rotate them periodically.
- Consider improving password complexity (min length 12, mix of upper/lowercase, numbers, symbols).

Contact

If you did not request these credentials or think they have been leaked, contact the system administrator immediately.
